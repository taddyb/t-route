"""The RFC DA index must be bounded by the array it indexes, not by the file count.

``total_counts`` reaches the kernel rebased off the RFC file's own value, while
``time_series`` is the pivoted observation frame, truncated at the persist horizon
and padded onto whatever grid the other stations in the domain imply. Nothing tied
the two together, so a forecast that ended before the run did walked the index off
the end of the memoryview and the whole joblib worker died with
``IndexError: Out of bounds on buffer access (axis 0)``.
