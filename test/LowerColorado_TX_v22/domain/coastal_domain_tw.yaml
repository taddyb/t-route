# Diffusive domain tailwater ID (int):
#   headwater (int): Segment IDs identifying any headwaters of the diffusive domain. A value of '999999' indicates
#                    to t-route that it should start at the tailwater ID and traverse upstream until a headwater or a waterbody
#                    reached. Traversing upstream will stop at any additional IDs that are provided, essentially making them
#                    headwaters of the diffusive domain.
