"""In-run application of the simple-scaling streamflow DA.

Wired into the NHF (-V5) run loop and the BMI driver. Before each ``nwm_route``
call, :meth:`ScalingDA.build_usgs_df` injects the accepted gage observations into
the Muskingum-Cunge nudging override, carrying the correction DOWNSTREAM through
routing. After routing, :meth:`ScalingDA.apply_in_kernel` reads the kernel-recorded
innovation (``nudge``), reconstructs the gage background, and spreads the
correction UPSTREAM (area-scaling along reaches, flow-ratio split at confluences).
Stale-obs decay follows ``da_decay_coefficient`` and IS carried across forcing
windows: ``DataAssimilation.update_after_compute`` harvests the kernel's lastobs for
scaling runs, so a gage that falls silent keeps decaying rather than resetting at a
boundary that ``max_loop_size`` happens to fall on. The frame rides in the BMI
checkpoint, so the continuity spans cycles as well.

Everything here is in ``up_node_id`` space, and the gage crosswalk comes from
``network.gages`` -- the same set the execution plan splits reaches at, so the
injection always lands on a reach boundary.

Observations come from the shared ``usgs_timeslices_folder`` through
``nhd_io.get_obs_from_timeslices`` (same QC gate and interpolation as nudging and
reservoir persistence, but over the run-spanning file list, not the per-window one), or synthetically as ``synthetic_obs_factor``
times a frozen no-DA baseline.

        Walk back in time from the gage, accumulating the distance the wave
        covered in each past timestep until it exceeds the reach's length, then
        carry on up the parent chain. What is being traced is the KINEMATIC WAVE,
        not the water: an innovation is a discharge perturbation, and by the
        Kleitz-Seddon law a perturbation moves at ``c = dQ/dA = beta * V``, which
        for a hydraulically wide Manning channel is ``(5/3) V``. Tracing with the
        water velocity would over-estimate travel time by that factor.

        ``ck`` is not assumed: the kernel computes it for the compound
        trapezoidal section, including the wetted-perimeter correction and the
        overbank blend, and exports it alongside the Courant number. Since
        ``cn = ck*dt/dx``, the distance covered in one timestep is exactly
        ``cn*dx``, so the trace works in units of reach length and never needs
        ``dx`` itself:

            steps back until   sum_k min(cn(reach, t-k), 1)  >=  1.0

        The ``min`` follows the MODEL, not the physics: the MC solver clamps
        K at ``max(dt, dx/Ck)`` and the discrete reach lag IS K, so the routed
        perturbation crosses at most one segment per timestep while the
        exported cn stays unclamped; tracing raw cn under-estimated tau by
        exactly the factor cn wherever cn > 1 (most event flow at NHF reach
        lengths).

        Every read is at an already-routed time (backward is well posed) and
        the span ``nt`` is FIXED (``lag_window_h``), so the resolved set cannot
        depend on the window partition. Unresolvable reaches return ``inf``.

        Returns ``(tau, counts)``; ``counts`` splits unresolved by cause,
        since only one of them is fixable by configuration:
        ``inherited`` (parent unresolved), ``no_cn`` (no Courant export, e.g.
        the diffusive domain), ``dry`` (no live sample ever), ``short``
        (record ended; a longer ``lag_window_h`` would resolve it),
        ``lower_bound`` (crossed only on the oldest sample).

        What an upstream segment needs at time t is the innovation the gage will
        report once this water arrives, ``dQ_o(t + tau)``: the segment's present
        state is corrected, not its past. Averaging over ``[t, t + T]`` is the
        estimator of that when tau is treated as unknown on the interval.

        The window is one-sided for that reason. A centred window would average
        in ``dQ_o(t - T/2)``, water that had already passed the gage, which is a
        negative travel time.

        Two properties of the edges, both deliberate and neither obvious:

        - The tail is padded with the LAST value, not with zeros, so the final
          timestep always comes out equal to its own raw innovation. That is
          what the forecast hand-off snapshots, so the seeded state is the same
          for every T. Zero padding would conserve volume at the tail instead
          but would shrink the seeded correction by a factor of the window.
        - Volume is therefore preserved only in the interior. An innovation
          within T of the START of the supplied series loses part of its mass
          (there are no earlier output steps to carry it) and one at the very
          END is amplified by the padding. Interior steps of a run are covered
          by the halo; the run's own first and last T hours are not.

        Width 0 leaves the innovation untouched and every property above becomes
