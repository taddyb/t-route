    now. The window is one-sided for that reason: hours t to t+width, never
    before t, since an earlier innovation describes water that had already gone
    past.

    The width is NOT derived from ``max_reach_km``. Converting that distance to
    an arrival time needs a celerity, and no defensible one was found (200 km is
    69 h at 0.8 m/s, so the two defaults do not describe the same interval).

    on the Ohio subset separated by 1.4 points of median absolute PBIAS, which
    four gages cannot resolve.

    0 applies the raw innovation. That is the honest default: it claims nothing

    approximate, and it needs no data from the next forcing window, so results
    cannot depend on the window partition."""

    The source proposal applies dQ(t) simultaneously at every subarea and says
    nothing about travel time. The shift is delivered as an agreed addition to
    that proposal, because a correction applied at one instant hundreds of km
    upstream is not physically meaningful.

    OFF by default (2026-08-17, measured record): the lag improves ANALYSIS
    timing (OSSE 2.00 h vs 6.00 h untimed), leaves held-out skill unchanged
    within resolution (13.1% vs 11.5%), and costs the FORECAST nothing by
    construction -- the hand-off instant is always seeded UNTIMED, so the
    forecast equals the untimed arm's. Off for runnability, not skill: the
    span must fit the opening update (fail-closed) and operational 3-28 h
    lookbacks cannot host the 48 h default, plus ~5% runtime. Enable where
    the cadence hosts the span and record timing matters.

    On, an upstream segment at time ``t`` is corrected by ``dQ_o(t + tau)``: a
    correction placed there routes down and reaches the gage at ``t + tau``, so
    this is the shift that makes the upstream field reproduce the innovation the
    gage actually observed. Off applies the innovation at the observation time,
    which is the proposal's own formulation.

    ``tau`` is traced BACKWARD along the characteristic from the router's own
    Courant number (``cn = ck*dt/dx``, so the trace accumulates ``cn`` to 1.0 and
    needs no reach length at all). Every read is therefore at a time already
    routed and held in memory, which is what makes the trace well posed; a
    forward trace would need celerity at ``t + tau``, and the attempt that froze
    the field at ``t`` instead read ambient celerity where an event was passing.
    What is traced is the KINEMATIC WAVE, not the water: by the Kleitz-Seddon law
    a discharge perturbation moves at ``c = dQ/dA = beta*V``, which is ``(5/3)V``
    for a wide Manning channel, so tracing the water velocity would over-estimate
    travel time by that factor.

    There is one estimator and one direction because there is one defensible
    answer for each. Every celerity that could be PICKED was measured and
    rejected (a constant cannot describe a continental network; the raw Courant
    number reports the AMBIENT wave speed, which gives 168 h over 39 km).
    Cross-correlating the routed hydrographs resolved 9.9% of segments against
    the trace's 87.7%, needed a significance gate to stop it fabricating lags
    from noise, and scored the same as applying no timing at all on the held-out
    gages. Applying the shift backward, ``dQ_o(t - tau)``, is ``2*tau`` late by
    construction and scored 12.00 h against 6.00 h for no timing on the OSSE.

    The trace follows the MODEL, not the physics: the solver clamps the
    Muskingum K at one timestep (``Km = max(dt, dx/Ck)``), so its perturbation
    crosses at most one segment per timestep however fast the physical celerity
    is, and the trace accumulates ``min(cn, 1)`` to match. Tracing the raw
    exported cn under-estimated tau by exactly that factor wherever ``cn > 1``,
    which at NHF reach lengths is most event flow.

    Unresolvable segments are excluded, never given a fallback speed; the
    DIFFUSIVE domain (no Courant export) drops with its subtrees deliberately.
    The run log counts unresolved segments by reason; only ``short`` resolves
    under a longer ``lag_window_h``. The drivers force ``return_courant`` on
    while the trace still needs it."""

    lag_window_h: float = Field(48.0, gt=0, allow_inf_nan=False)
    """Hours of routed flow the travel time is traced over, once per run.

    Deliberately NOT the forcing window. The span decides the answer, so a lag
    traced over each window would make ``max_loop_size``, a memory knob, change
    discharge: measured on the Ohio subset, per-window traces moved the median
    tau across 12.1 to 14.4 h in one run, and the resolved SET moved with it
    because the walk stops at the start of the record. Slicing a fixed span from
    the run's start makes every partition read the same data, and both drivers
    enlarge a short first window to cover it.

    It is therefore also the cap on what can be resolved at all: a segment whose
    accumulated Courant number does not cross its reach within the span, or that
    crosses only on the oldest sample the span holds, is excluded rather than
    given a lower bound dressed up as a measurement.

    The trade is a real one. A longer span resolves longer travel times but is
