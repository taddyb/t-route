# T-Route - Tree-Based Channel Routing 

**Fast, flexible, modular channel routing for the National water model and beyond**:  

T-Route, a dynamic channel routing model, offers a comprehensive solution for river network routing problems. It is designed to handle 1-D channel routing challenges in vector-based river network data, such as the USGS's NHDPlus High Resolution dataset, and OGC WaterML 2.0 Surface Hydrology Features (HY_Features) data model used in NextGen framework.

Provided a series lateral inflows for each node in a channel network, T-Route computes the resulting streamflows. T-Route requires that all routing computations srictly obey an upstream-to-downstream ordering. Such ordering facilitates the heterogenous application of routing models in a single river network. For example, hydrologic models - such as Muskingum Cunge - may be more appropriate for low-order headwater streams where backwater conditions have minimal impact on flooding. In contrast, T-Route empowers users to apply computationally intensive hydraulic models, such as the diffusive wave approximation of St. Venant equations, for high-order streams and rivers, where backwater flooding is a significant concern. This flexibility enables users to allocate computational resources precisely where they are needed most, optimizing efficiency.

Expanding its capabilities, T-Route now supports the OGC WaterML 2.0 Surface Hydrology Features (HY_Features) data model, facilitating the management of complex acyclic network connectivity. HY_Features data model provides users with a choice of routing solutions, including Muskingum-Cunge, Diffusive Wave, or Dynamic Wave.

**Key Features of T-Route:**
- Adaptable to multiple network formulations.
- Supports a range of routing solutions.
- Redesigned core operations accessible via standard BMI functions.
- Modular design for independent reservoir and data assimilation modules.
- Capable of disaggregating routing across large spatial domains.
- Facilitates heterogenous application of routing models in a single network.

## Routing Model Comparisons
| Feature | Muskingum-Cunge (MC) | Diffusive Wave |
|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| Domain | Individual stream segment | Independent sub-network |
| Computing Method | Parallel on CONUS using junction order and short-time step | Serial on a sub-network using junction order |
| Routing Direction | Upstream to downstream | Both directions |
| Numerical Scheme | [One-dimensional explicit scheme](https://ral.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/public/WRF-HydroV5TechnicalDescription.pdf) | [Implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.13080) |

T-Route's flexible design is ideal for NOAA's National Water Model (NWM) 3.0, but its utility extends to various research and practical applications. While the code is currently bespoke for NWM, efforts are ongoing to generalize the core utilities, making T-Route compatible with any standardized network and forcing data.

## General Sheme:
The figure below illustrates the workflow for executing T-Route via two interfaces: the Command Line Interface (CLI) and the Basic Model Interface (BMI). When using the CLI, the user can select from two river network representations: NHDNetwork or HYFeatures. In contrast, the BMI exclusively supports HYFeatures. For the routing method, users have the option to apply either the Muskingum-Cunge method or the Diffusive Wave method.

## Project Overview:
- **Technology Stack**: Combines Python with Fortran for core routing model engines. The river network pre-processor, river network traversal framework, and time series data model are all written in python. The routing model engines (e.g. Muskingum-Cunge and diffusive wave) are primarily written in fortran, though we can imagine future additions to the engine suite being writted in any number of laguages that can be packaged as python extensions.
- **Current Status**: Focused on integration with NWM 3.0.
- **Demonstrations**: The `/test` directory includes a T-Route demonstration on the Lower Colorado River, TX, showcasing capabilities like streamflow data assimilation and diffusive wave routing.

## Mission Alignment
T-Route development is rigorously aligned with and guided by the NOAA Office of Water Prediction mission: *Collaboratively research, develop and deliver timely and consistent, state-of-the-science national hydrologic analyses, forecast information, data, guidance and equitable decision-support services to inform essential emergency management and water resources decisions across all time scales.*

## Structure of Folders:
- `src/kernel/`: Fortran modules.
- `src/troute-config/`: Configuration parser for T-Route specific file.
- `src/troute-network/`: Manages network, data assimilation, and routing types.
- `src/troute-nwm/`: Coordinates T-Route’s modules.
- `src/troute-routing/`: Handles flow segment and reservoir routing modules.

## Summary:
T-Route represents streamflow channel routing and reservoir routing, assimilating data on vector-based channel networks. It fits into a broader framework where it interacts with land surface models, Forcing Engines, and coastal models, each playing a pivotal role in hydrologic forecasting and analysis.

### T-Route Setup Instructions and Troubleshooting Guide for Windows Users

**Note**: The following instructions are for setting up T-Route on a Linux environment (standalone, no MPI). If you are using Windows, please install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) before proceeding.

### T-Route Setup and Testing Guide for Windows Users WITHOUT conda [based on pip and venv - only widely available dependencies].
### WARNING: INSTALLATION WITHIN EXISTING MINICONDA/CONDA VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT NOT RECOMMENDED, PIP AND CONDA DO NOT MIX WELL, AND YOU MAY BREAK YOUR CONDA ENVIRONMENT!

1. **Install Recommended distro:**
   - Download and install WSL2 for your Windows OS
   - We recommend long-term stable (LTS) Ubuntu distribution 22.04 or 20.04 (24.04 not recommended yet)
   - Open Windows Power Shell and issue
      ``` shell
      wsl --install Ubuntu-22.04
      ```
   - Enter (root) username and password (2x) of your choice
     
2. **Set up venv-based virtual environment:**
   - From root (the username you created under 1):
      - Update Linux distro:
        ```shell
        sudo apt update
        ```
      - Install pip (package manager):
        ```shell
        sudo apt install python3-pip
        ```
      - Install venv:
         ```shell
         sudo apt install python3.10-venv
         ```
      - Create a virtual environment for T-Route (named here 'troute-env1'):
         ```shell
         python3 -m venv troute_env1
         ```
      - Activate your shiny new virtual environment:
         ```shell
         source troute_env1/bin/activate
         ```
      - Now, the command prompts in the Shell window should start with (troute-env1)
 
3. **Clone T-Route:**
   - Go to a folder of your choice (here, your home folder) and create a T-Route directory
      ```shell
      mkdir troute1
      cd troute1
      ```
   - Clone a T-Route repository (the current main branch is used as an example):
      ```shell
      git clone --progress --single-branch --branch master http://github.com/NOAA-OWP/T-Route.git
      cd troute1
      ```
   - Install python packages per requirements file
      ```shell
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

4. **Download & build netcdf fortran libraries from UCAR:**
   - Go to a folder of your choice (here, your home folder) and download the source code:
      ```shell
      cd ~
      wget https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-fortran/4.6.1/netcdf-fortran-4.6.1.tar.gz
      ```
   - Unzip it:
      ```shell
      tar xvf netcdf-fortran-4.6.1.tar.gz
      ```
   - Enter the directory:
      ```shell
      cd netcdf-fortran-4.6.1/
      ```
   - Install some prerequisites (Fortran compiler, build essentials, standard C-netcdf library):
      ```shell
      sudo apt install gfortran
      sudo apt install build-essential
      sudo apt-get install libnetcdf-dev
      ```
   - Configure the fortran-netcdf libraries:
      ```shell
      ./configure
      ```
   - There should be no error message, and the output log should end up with something like:
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48268212-0b74-4f75-9d52-97f68e6c80d0)
   - Check the installation (running two sets of examples):
      ```shell
      make check
      ```
   - Again, there should be no error message (expect some warnings, though), and output should end with "passing" of two sets:
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83745989-9f14-4c1b-a2a1-675aa94e5181)
   - Finally, install the libraries:
      ```shell
      sudo make install
      ```
   - Output should be something like:
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57e48501-18f4-4004-9b10-5a9245186e38)

5. **Build and test T-Route:**
   - Go to your T-Route folder:
      ```shell
      cd ~/troute1
      ```
   - Compile T-Route (may take a few minutes, depending on the machine):
      ```shell
      ./compiler.sh
      ```
   - Set path to runtime netcdf-Fortran library [recommend including this in the .bashrc file or your equivalent]:
      ```shell
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/
      ```
   - Run one of the demo examples provided:
      ```shell
      cd test/LowerColorado_TX
      python3 -m nwm_routing -f -V4 test_AnA_V4_NHD.yaml
      ```
   - The latter is a hybrid (MC + diffusive) routing example that should run within a few minutes at most
